/* PLEASE ENSURE THAT ON TOP OF YOUR CSS CODE, INCLUDE A COMMENT WITH YOUR SLACK HANDLE OR NAME!!!! */
/* This just makes everything a bit more cleaner and easy for other people to add ships! */
/* Lastly, make sure that your CSS doesn't interfere with other people's ships, so all your class names should start with 


.yourname-xxxxxx{
  (css here)
} 

*/
/* THANK YOU!! */
