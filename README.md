# arcade-24
Make something meaningful! 

## what is this
For the last few hours of Arcade, we want to have as much fun as we can and work on something together. That's why we created this repo!

**We decided on making a page of all of your amazing projects. Think r/place, but for all the things we've cooked up during arcade!

## how do i contribute??
If you made ANYTHING during arcade (games, art, CAD, IRL projects, literally anything), you're free to open a PR on this repo and add it to index.html
**Be creative!** Don't just add images. For example, if you made a game, try including a live, playable demo of it. Add as many things as you can, we want that page full of ships!!
