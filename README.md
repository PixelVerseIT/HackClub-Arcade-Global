Make something meaningful! 

## what is this
For the last few hours of Arcade, we want to have as much fun as we can and work on something together. That's why we created this repo!

## what should i make
There's probably gonna be some people discussing it in the Slack server. When somebody decides what to work on, join them and help them out!

## the only rule
The project must be in Python or Javascript, as those are languages that almost everybody who knows programming is familiar with.
